The website that I have created is a website that mainly focuses on selling football related stuff such as jerseys and gifts of a club, and the brand name is called FTB.


This website is mainly targeted to the football audience out there who are a huge fan of their club where they would buy the jerseys to either wear them or collect them. Since young, I have always been a huge football fan and would often buy jerseys with my friends online, but the webistes that we always go to is not very user friendly and has too many features which we find too hectic to use. Hence, it is also one of my reason to create this website which is much more user friendly and easier to navigate around.

For the first part of the project which is the home page, I have implemented two slider for the products, where by you are able to click on one of them which would bring you to the mens page and from there you are able to click on the product which will bring you to another page where you can add it to cart and choose the size you want. From there you can go to the cart which shows the product inside it and you are also able to see your order total and you can also remove it from the cart if you were to change your mind and not buy it. After that you can go to the payment page and in that page, you would be required to input your name, address and also card information in order to pay. There is also a others page where it includes a map of the shop location and also contact informations. The mens, womens, kids and gifts page are similar.
A future idea that I could implement would be a favourite page where users would be able to favourite the product which would be stored in a favourite page.


For the framework, I used figma to create my low-fidality where it shows how my website would look like once I have finished it but they are also changes made from it as well. For the website, I have used the language HTML, CSS and also javascript to make the website functional.


In my payment page, there is this feature where by you are required to enter your information in order for you to pay and if you were to leave one of it blank, there would be a pop up stating required to fill. The website looks different when you are on your phone compared to your laptop due to the media query implemented and this was used so as to keep the webpages neat at all times.
Theres also a problem where I could not fix in the media query, which was not being able to use the slider for the picture smoothly.
